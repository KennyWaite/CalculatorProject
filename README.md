# CalculatorProject

HTML/Styling (SCSS BEM):
Will need a grid container for all buttons on the calc
Need to change colour to match calculator
On a black background and is responsive (MQ)
Might need a little box next to it with instructions and limitations of calc


JS:
Need display screen to have placeholder that turns into the displays number clicked in calc
Display screen that has placeholder of “calculation will appear here”
Number is pressed 
Display screen removes placeholder and is replaced by number
If another number is pressed, concatenate these numbers 
If decimal is pressed, concatenate this with number and continue
Set a maximum(?) of 8 numbers are able to be concat before decimal and 8 after decimal (total 16 numbers?)
If not a number or “.” is pressed, then check to see what function
If not a number pressed must mean it is a function > Match it with the correct function operator pressed 
Also added to the display when pressed
If another function is pressed - display error (only one function at a time) & prompt user to add another number
Need to have these variables on a while loop or held in storage until = is pressed and it executes function
Parameters will be (number)(operator)(number)(equals)
Will need to output this display into the screen
Parent Child Appending as in lesson 
Need a clear function that refreshes the display and clears the memory
